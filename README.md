# Calculator GUI
Created by acatia#0001

## How it works
This calculator allows you to do simple math equations with + - / * operators. You can use decimal places and brackets.

## How to use
Clone the Git repository by doing:

```
git clone https://github.com/acatiadroid/calculator-gui
```

Or if you do not want to clone the repo, you can just copy the code from the [`app.py`](https://github.com/acatiadroid/calculator-gui/blob/main/app.py) file.

> ⚠️ NOTE: if you do not clone the GitHub repository, go to the bottom of the [`app.py`](https://github.com/acatiadroid/calculator-gui/blob/main/app.py) file and remove the line that says:
```
root.iconbitmap(r'calc.ico')
```

otherwise it will raise an error.
