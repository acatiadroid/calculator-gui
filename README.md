# Calculator GUI
Created by acatia#0001

## How it works
This calculator allows you to do simple math equations with + - / * operators. You can use decimal places and brackets.

## How to use
Clone the Git repository by doing:

```
git clone https://github.com/acatiadroid/calculator-gui
```

Or if you do not want to clone the repo, you can just copy the code from the [`app.py`](https://github.com/acatiadroid/calculator-gui/blob/main/app.py) file.

> ⚠️ NOTE: if you do not clone the GitHub repository, the window bitmap icon (the little icon in the top left corner) will not show and instead will show the default Tkinter icon. This will not affect calculator functionality in any way.
